<p align='center'>Contiguity's official JavaScript SDK.</p>

## Installation üèó & Setup üõ†
You can install the SDK using NPM. 
```shell
$ npm install @contiguity/javascript
```

Then, import & initialize it like this:
```js
const contiguity = require('@contiguity/javascript')
const client = contiguity.login("your token here")
```

You can also initialize it with the optional 'debug' flag:
```js
const client = contiguity.login("your token here", true)
```

You can get your token from the Contiguity [dashboard](https://contiguity.co/dashboard).

## Sending your first email üì§

As long as you provided Contiguity a valid token, and provide valid inputs, sending emails will be a breeze!

To begin sending an email with an HTML body, you can define a JSON object with all the required fields.

```js
const object = {
    to: "example@example.com",
    from: "Contiguity",
    subject: "My first email!",
    html: "<b>I sent an email using Contiguity</b>"
}

await client.send.email(object)
```

To send an email with a text body, it's very similar. Just switch "html" to "text".
```js
const object = {
    to: "example@example.com",
    from: "Contiguity",
    subject: "My first email!",
    text: "I sent an email using Contiguity"
}

await client.send.email(object)
```

_async/await is recommend, but technically not required._

### Optional fields:
- `replyTo` allows you set a reply-to email address. 
- `cc` allows you to CC an email address

You can also fetch a local email template using `client.template.local(file)`:

```js
const template = await client.template.local('templates/first_email.html')

const object = {
    to: "example@example.com",
    from: "Contiguity",
    subject: "My first email!",
    html: template,
}

await client.send.email(object)
```

## Sending your first text message üí¨

As long as you provided Contiguity a valid token, and will provide valid inputs, sending texts will be a breeze!

To begin sending a text message, you can define a JSON object with all the required fields.

```js
const object = {
    to: "+15555555555",
    message: "My first text using Contiguity"
}

await client.send.text(object)
```

**Note**: _Contiguity expects the recipient phone number to be formatted in E.164. You can attempt to pass numbers in formats like NANP, and the SDK will try its best to convert it. If it fails, it will throw an error!_

## Sending your first OTP üîë

Contiguity aims to make communications extremely simple and elegant. In doing so, we're providing an OTP API to send one time codes - for free (no additional charge, the text message is still billed / added to quota)

To send your first OTP, first create one:
```js
const otp_id = await client.otp.send({ 
    to: "+15555555555", 
    language: "en", 
    name: "Contiguity" 
})
```
Contiguity supports 33 languages for OTPs, including `English (en)`, `Afrikaans (af)`, `Arabic (ar)`, `Catalan (ca)`, `Chinese / Mandarin (zh)`, `Cantonese (zh-hk)`, `Croatian (hr)`, `Czech (cs)`, `Danish (da)`, `Dutch (nl)`, `Finnish (fi)`, `French (fr)`, `German (de)`, `Greek (el)`, `Hebrew (he)`, `Hindi (hi)`, `Hungarian (hu)`, `Indonesian (id)`, `Italian (it)`, `Japanese (ja)`, `Korean (ko)`, `Malay (ms)`, `Norwegian (nb)`, `Polish (pl)`, `Portuguese - Brazil (pt-br)`, `Portuguese (pt)`, `Romanian (ro)`, `Russian (ru)`, `Spanish (es)`, `Swedish (sv)`, `Tagalog (tl)`, `Thai (th)`, `Turkish (tr)`, and `Vietnamese (vi)`

_The `name` parameter is optional, it customizes the message to say "Your \[name] code is ..."_

To verify an OTP a user has inputted, simply call `client.otp.verify()`:

```js
const verify = await client.otp.verify({
    otp_id: otp_id // you received this when you called client.otp.send(),
    otp: input // the 6 digits your user inputted.
})
```
It will return a boolean (true/false). The OTP expires 15 minutes after sending it.

## Verify formatting
Contiguity provides two functions that verify phone number and email formatting, which are:

```js
client.verify.number("number")
```
and
```js
client.verify.email("example@example.com")
```
They return a boolean (true/false)

**Note**: _This occurs locally, and is not part of Contiguity's online verification service._

## Email analytics
If you sent an HTML email, and chose Contiguity to track it, you can fetch an email's status (delivered/read) using:

```js
await client.email_analytics.retrieve("email_id")
```

## Quota
If you'd like to retrieve your quota, whether you're on our free tier or Unlimited, you can fetch it using:

```js
await client.quota.retrieve()
```

You'll receive an object similar to the `crumbs` the API provides on completion of every request.

## Errors
The SDK really loves to throw errors when things don't go its way, like if a field isn't provided or the API returns a 500. It is recommended to wrap everything in a try/catch block.

## Roadmap üö¶
- Contiguity Identity will be supported
- Adding support for calls
- Adding support for webhooks
- Adding support for online templates
- and way more.
